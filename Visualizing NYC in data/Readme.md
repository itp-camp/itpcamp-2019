## Description

This workshop introduces students to a variety of code-based methods for visualizing urban data. 
The first portion of the workshop will cover the fundamentals of obtaining, analyzing, and visualizing data, as well as how to avoid common mistakes that occur when working on a data-related project. 

The second portion of the workshop will be a hands-on tutorial where students will learn how to visualize geospatial data using Python's geopandas library. Some experience working with Python is recommended but by no means necessary.

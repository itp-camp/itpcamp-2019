## Session description
"You can always tell when the groove is working or not." Prince

I like to introduce you to the Concept of Groove in Music as a tool that can help to make your artistic projects more breathe and resonate.

Music starts to breath and come alive when it finds this captivating balance between tension and release.

We will look at Concepts used in Arranging and Composition that help to build up this tension and release like: - Motive Development - Layering - Foreshadowing - Rhytmic Displacement.
